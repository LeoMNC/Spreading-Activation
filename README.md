# Spreading-Activation
This is a NetLogo implementation of a common spreading-activation algorithm, which has applications in cognitive science. 
The model itself is contained in the NetLogo file. There is significant documentation on the Information Tab in the NetLogo file.
Also included are the results from two BehaviorSpace experiments along with two R Markdown files analyzing these results.
The comparison experiment serves to show that the NetLogo implementation faithfully reproduces the behavior from previous implementations.
The Experiment 1 analysis explores the model's behavior and will be presented in context in an upcoming publication.
